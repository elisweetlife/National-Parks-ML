Food and drink at the visitor’s center is great too, In the parks themselves, I really like social isolation. I want to hear the wind in the trees, the water and animals. I don’t want to be in a tour group or on a crowded trail. I don’t like picnic spots because people tend to trash them. I really hate seeing people act inconsiderate in nature.
